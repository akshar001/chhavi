# Chhavi - A key to unlock everything!

Welcome to our repo.

This is our initial page for our hardware resources, firmware resources, and examples.

We have put down one Arduino Example App, 
Which hosts http server and web-socket server, 
Fingerprint sensors can communicate with it and show you a live data in browser.

For hardware resources, we will put the files after our crowd-supply campaign starts.

For the firmware you can go through it now.

You'll need these libraries to start with ardunino,
